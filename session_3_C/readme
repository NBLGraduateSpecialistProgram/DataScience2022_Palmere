Setup for linking to DISLIN library on MAC OSX (taken from DISLIN readme):

1.) Download OpenMotif dependency (https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmotif-mac/) 

2.) Open .dmg file and copy OpenMotif21 to Applications folder

3.) Nagivate to /Applications/OpenMotif21/lib and create a symbol link:
	cd /Applications/OpenMotif21/lib
	ln -s libXm.3.1.dylib libXm.dylib

4.) untar and navigate to the dislin-11.4 directory and provide where DISLIN should be installed using environment variable:
	cd dislin-11.4
	export DISLIN=$HOME/dislin

5.) Install
	./INSTALL

6.) Edit /etc/profile to include:
	DISLIN=directory
	export DISLIN
	PATH = ${PATH}:${DISLIN}/bin
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export DYD_LIBRARY_PATH

Dislin Structure:

Most routines in DISLIN can be called anywhere during program execution. Certain routines, however,
use parameters from other routines and must be called in a fixed order. DISLIN uses a level structure to
control the order in which routines are called. The levels are:

0 before initialization or after termination
1 after initialization or a call to ENDGRF
2 after a call to GRAF or POLAR
3 after a call to GRAF3 or GRAF3D.

Generally, programs should have the following structure:
(1) setting of page format, file format and filename
(2) initialization
(3) setting of plot parameters
(4) plotting of the axis system
(5) plotting the title
(6) plotting data points
(7) termination.
