# ./setup.py build_Ext --inplace 

# Outputs translation of Python code to C as well as the library for importation (.so or "shared object" for OSX or .pyd "python dynamic?" - these are basically dynamic link libraries ready to be imported by your Python interpreter) 

# ./matrix_test.py to test this importation and execution of Cythonized code

# Note - the .so or .pyd must be within the same working directory to be imported
